Room names, filenames and IDs
--------------

A listing of all rooms by area. Each section is ordered by room ID (room number).
The ID can be used to teleport to the room using the DM `go room_id` command
(e.g. `go 1` would teleport to The Underworld). Room constants are listed in
`/kod/include/blakston.khd` (e.g. RID_UNDERWORLD = 1 for The Underworld) and all
.roo files are in `/resource/rooms/`.
