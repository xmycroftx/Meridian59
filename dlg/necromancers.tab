Izzio		Necromancers	~kIzzio says, "Well folk are folk no matter who they worship."
Izzio		Hunters	~kIzzio says, "It's not my place to make judgements on anyone."
Izzio		Necromancer amulet	~kIzzio smiles broadly, "I bet that would fetch a pretty penny."
Izzio		sword of the hunt	~kIzzio says, "I can respect the owner of one of those."
PrincessLiege		necromancers	~kPrincess Kateriina says, "Many have told me that they indeed walk the land.  I think we need to find out where and why?"
PrincessLiege		hunters	~kPrincess Kateriina says, "If indeed the necromancers are out there, let us also hope that the hunters are there as well."
PrincessLiege		hunters	~kPrincess Kateriina says, "The story says that Kara'set was the first hunter of this kind. The story also relates that she wielded a magical sword which was taken by Venya'cyr."
PrincessLiege		necromancer amulet	~kPrincess Kateriina says, "This hard evidence would surely prove there is more to the old story than I originally thought.  Bring me one of these pendants."
PrincessLiege		sword of the hunt	~kPrincess Kateriina says, "I have heard that their swords contain magical properties particularly potent against those with black souls."
PrincessLiege		necromancer amulet	~kPrincess Kateriina says, "Bring me one of these pendants.  It is vital that we have a chance to study such an artifact."
PrincessLiege		Tendrath	~kPrincess Kateriina says, "He is the old mage who caused the city of Brax to be swallowed by the earth.  He also forged the hunter swords.  A sad tale is his."
PrincessLiege		lich	~kPrincess Kateriina says, "The evil forces of the Urn transformed Venya'cyr into a being called the Lich.  The legend says that the Lich can not be killed."
OneCouncilor		lich	~kAlzahakar says, "The lich is the transformed soul of the ancient queen of Brax.  Her name was Venya'cyr.  She was tempted by these ancient forces.  They used her own noble desires to corrupt her."
OneCouncilor		lich	~kAlzahakar says, "I believe that Venya'cyr can never die.  That is the curse.  The more she uses these ancient powers the less of the noble queen survives.  Perhaps by now she is complete in her vileness."
OneCouncilor		Hunter	~kAlzahakar says, "They are the children of Tendrath the mage.  Their swords give them a great power to wield, but it also demands a sacrifice which might seem brutal to some."
OneCouncilor		hunter 	~kAlzahakar says, "The hunter has sworn eternal vengeance against the necromancers and all those who take the lives of the innocent.  To know that the hunters are on your trail is to know fear."
OneCouncilor		Necromancer amulet	~kAlzahakar says, "The Necromancer amulet is worn by all who directly serve the Lich.  They are a mouth with which the Lich can feed.  All those who die by the hand of a necromancer feed the hunger of the Lich."
OneCouncilor		sword of the hunt	~kAlzahakar says, "Tendrath forged the magical swords to slay the Lich.  The swords were lost to the Lich when the bravest warriors, sent to destroy Venya'cyr, were themselves undone by her power.  The swords are potent against the necromancers but can not kill the Lich."
TwoCouncilor		lich	~kBei Naq says, "Do I look like a historian to you? I am a simple man, do not ask me about such things."
TwoCouncilor		Hunter	~kBei Naq says, "I know nothing of these landless zealots."
TwoCouncilor		necromancer amulet	~kBei Naq says, "I would very much like to acquire one of these pendants.  I am sure they would be priceless."
TwoCouncilor		sword of the hunt	~kBei Naq says, "I would love to get my hands on one of those swords.  It would certainly be worth a fortune if not priceless."
ThreeCouncilor		lich	~kCylill says, "There was supposedly a fortress built with some ancient magic.  The owner of that fortress was the Lich.  Supposedly the castle had a maze that prevented even the largest forces from entering her realm.  Of course the fear of the Urn probably kept most folk from trying."
ThreeCouncilor		Urn	~kCylill says, "The Urn was the original source of the Lich's power. It was through the forces of the Urn that Queen Venya'cyr was corrupted."
ThreeCouncilor		venya'cyr	~kCylill says, "She was the sister of a impotent king whom all the folk of the land despised. He was a weak minded man with no training in the field and no knowledge of either diplomacy or warfare."
ThreeCouncilor		hunter	~kCylill says, "I fear men who serve no visible leader.  They are likely to become vigilantes and then I will have to deal with them.  I do not fear them on a personal level, mind you, I fear their lack of guidance or chain of command."
ThreeCouncilor		necro pendant	~kCylill says, "People who rely on magics such as this are vulnerable in a way that common folk such as ourselves are not.  It would be wise to investigate the nature of their power."
ThreeCouncilor		sword of the hunt	~kCylill says, "Having seen one in use, I am not so sure there is that much difference between the Hunters and the Necromancers."
FourCouncilor		Lich	~kDrechx says, "From what I have heard, the lich can not die.  Her body is transformed by the powers that corrupted her.  I wonder what it is like to live forever?"
FourCouncilor		hunter	~kDrechx says, "The hunters relationship with her sword seems unhealthy to me.  It is unnatural, and hence it is not good for the body."
FourCouncilor		Necromancer amulet	~kDrechx says, "The Necromancers pervert all life with their very existence.  The pendant is the culmination of this perversion.  Do you know that the only thing a Necromancer can eat is the life force of the living.  Real food is like poison to it."
FourCouncilor		sword of the hunt	~kDrechx says, "Anything that makes the body dependant on foreign material is ultimately bad for the person.  I know these weapons seem to aid the Hunter immensely but I often wonder about the toll it takes on the body."
FourCouncilor		Necromancer amulet	~kDrechx says, "This is how the Necromancers feed both themselves and their Queen.  It is truly vile.  I know only what Alzahakar tells me."
FourCouncilor		sword of the hunt	~kDrechx says, "I hear that it is magical."
FiveCouncilor		lich	~kEsseldi says, "Ah, you have heard the story of Venya'cyr.  Supposedly the lich can never travel from her cursed city."
FiveCouncilor		Hunter	~kEsseldi says, "I have heard of them."
FiveCouncilor		necromancer amulet	~kEsseldi says, "I would like to see one of these pendants."
FiveCouncilor		sword of the hunt	~kEsseldi says, "I would be interested in seeing one of these swords."
FiveCouncilor		urn	~kEsseldi says, "I remember there was an urn in  the story of Venya'cyr but I do not remember what its significance is."
FarenPriestess		necromancer	~kPriestess Tenuv'vyal says, "Their existence is an abomination of nature.  They should be destroyed."
FarenPriestess		Hunter	~kPriestess Tenuv'vyal says, "They seem a noble group.  They have vision and a respect for nature that is refreshing. Can they stop the Necromancers? That is the question."
FarenPriestess		necromancer amulet	~kPriestess Tenuv'vyal says, "They are instruments of death and decay and should be destroyed at the first possible opportunity."
FarenPriestess		sword of the hunt	~kPriestess Tenuv'vyal says, "A noble weapon for a noble purpose.  The hunter sword is a magnificent creation.  A admirable representation of a true hero."
FarenPriestess		Urn	~kPriestess Tenuv'vyal says, "It is the root of this plague of unnatural happenings in the land.  It should be cast into the deepest chasm if not utterly annihilated."
KraananPriestess		Necromancer	~kPriestess Qerti'nya says, "The path of the Necromancer is a path of weakness.  A stout warrior should fear nothing about these creatures.  They fall to a sword just as the living do."
KraananPriestess		hunters	~kPriestess Qerti'nya says, "They are a brave an mighty group.  They are welcome in the house of The Fist."
KraananPriestess		necromancer amulet	~kPriestess Qerti'nya says, "It is often the way for weaker beings to enhance their abilities with magical baubles.  Of course the necromancers need such things."
KraananPriestess		sword of the hunt	~kPriestess Qerti'nya says, "A useful weapon.  I consider it dangerous to rely on such things for success in combat."
QorPriestess		Necromancer amulet	~kPriestess Zuxana says, "It is an interesting artifact. I am certain that if I had time to study one of them I could enlighten all of us with its exact composition and abilities.  Unfortunately, I have no one to bring me one of these pendants. Shame."
QorPriestess		sword of the hunt	~kPriestess Zuxana says, "Everyone seems to just accept these Hunters for what they are.  I see a group of killers, stalking humans with the permission of our government.  What sort of society do we live in?  I see terrible hypocrisy in this. What is the difference between the Hunters and the Necromancers?  One of these groups has a good connection with our leader."
QorPriestess		The urn	~kPriestess Zuxana says, "I have begun to study ancient relics in order to better understand the world we have evolved from.  You could say I collect such things.  I would pay a fair price for this old fossil.  At very least it may prove a interesting new ornament for the temple."
ShalillePriestess		Necromancers	~kPriestess Xiana says, "There are no redeeming qualities in these creatures.  There is no mercy or humanity in them. They exist to take life.  They are completely blind to the ways Of Shal'ille."
ShalillePriestess		Hunter	~kPriestess Xiana says, "~bKilling people is wrong, no matter how justified the reasons may be.  There must be a solution to our problems that does not involve the spilling of blood.~k"
ShalillePriestess		necromancer amulet	~kPriestess Xiana says, "These things should not even be touched.  Their ability to corrupt is almost instantaneous and irreversible. Leave their destruction to the higher powers."
ShalillePriestess		sword of the hunt	~kPriestess Xiana says, "What is the difference between the  poisonous snake and the constrictor? Stay clear of all things related to the Hunters' work."
RiijaMonk		necromancer	~kThe Monk of Riija says, "There is a parasite that lives inside me.  To kill the parasite I must kill myself."
RiijaMonk		hunter	~kThe Monk of Riija says, "Once upon a time, the prince and the princess lived happily ever after."
RiijaMonk		necromancer amulet	~kThe Monk of Riija says, "Imagine always eating but never getting full."
RiijaMonk		Necromancer amulet	~kThe Monk of Riija says, "Imagine always eating but never getting full."
RiijaMonk		sword of the hunt	~kThe Monk of Riija says, "What did you say, the hunger sword?"
DarkWizard		Necromancer	~kMaleval says, "They are proof that things are not so neat as the priestesses would have you believe. Of course there are other forces of immense power in our world."
DarkWizard		Hunter	~kMaleval says, "They will be no match for the dark forces which they supposedly hunt.  Their undoing will be their swords."
DarkWizard		Lich	~kMaleval says, "The lich is the first incarnation of the Ancient One in this realm.  It is a child of darkness that will bring others to this land. It is a messenger of doom for this world.  The Ancient One has been awakened."
DarkWizard		amulet	~kMaleval says, "A toy for children who wish to live forever and lose their soul.  A truly remarkable invention."
DarkWizard		sword of the hunt	~kMaleval says, "Please entertain the notion that the hunters and the necromancers serve the same function.  Their methods and ideologies may be separate, but make no mistake, they both eat souls."
DarkWizard		Urn	~kMaleval says, "The Ancient One, long ago, created instruments through which it could manipulate the environment.  This is done to prepare the way for its rebirth. The urn is one such instrument."
MarionElder		Lich	~kRan er'Hoth says, "It is rumored that this creature can not die.  Which poses a great obstacle for those who would see it's dark reign thwarted."
MarionElder		Necromancer	~kRan er'Hoth says, "These are the dirty teeth which feed the mouth that can not be satiated.  They serve only the Lich and it's nefarious designs."
MarionElder		Necromancer amulet	~kRan er'Hoth says, "Do not touch these things!  Even the slightest contact with them could be harmful to those who are still among the living."
MarionElder		Hunter	~kRan er'Hoth says, "They are killers.  The question then becomes, 'Is there a place for justified vigilantes in our land?'  My answer is yes."
MarionElder		sword of the hunt	~kRan er'Hoth says, "They eat souls."
Heretic		Lich	~kMiriana says, "The Lich is the hungry mouth of a child that feeds the mother.  The mother sleeps while the child feeds her.  Ha! Imagine that.  Shhhh."
Heretic		Necromancer	~kMiriana says, "I have seen them. They remind me of crows.  I tried to make one some soup and he and he started to cry."
Heretic		Necromancer amulet	~kMiriana says, "Oh pretty, pretty necklace! Ouch!  Hey, leave my soul alone, pretty necklace.  I just want... I just want to... I just want to look pretty too."
Heretic		Hunter	~kMiriana says, "What do they do with their catches, these hunters?  Do they eat their catches?  Do they make coats out of their hides?  Do they put their stuffed heads in a room? I am just wondering."
Heretic		sword of the hunt	~kMiriana says, "The swords are as dangerous as their prey."
JasperElder		Lich	~kAfiera D'xor says, "Eventually there will come a point when we will have to deal with the Lich in battle.  The time is now to find out about your enemy."
JasperElder		Necromancer	~kAfiera D'xor says, "The pendant is a point of power for the necromancer.  It is also a point of vulnerability.  Understand this and perhaps they can be overcome. Make no mistake, they intend to overcome us."
JasperElder		Necromancer 	~kAfiera D'xor says, "Destroy them at all costs."
JasperElder		hunter 	~kAfiera D'xor says, "They are little better than the Necromancers, if you ask me."
JasperElder		sword of the hunt	~kAfiera D'xor says, "It is a tool of death.  Let us hope these Hunters have at least a shred of moral fiber."
HunterGhost		Necromancer	~kTendrath says, "They must be destroyed at all costs!  Those vile monsters crave nothing but total consumption of all life forces here in Meridian.  They are the pathetic pawns of their queen.  If you destroy them you weaken the Lich.  If you defeat the Lich the necromancers will be destroyed.  Of course, Venya'cyr can never be killed.  You must find a way to contain her infectious power.  Defeating her gives you a temporary respite, but we are all fated to watch her rise again."
HunterGhost		Lich	~kTendrath says, "The Lich is the first manifestation of an ancient presence within this world.  There is a story of a creature, older than the world, that sleeps within it.  I believe the Lich's powers springs from this creature.  I understand that you have many gods.  It would be best if these beings aided us now.  Let us hope they listen to your prayers.  Whether they do or not, you can be assured that I will never rest until she is gone. I have learned not to count on the gods."
HunterGhost		Hunter	~kTendrath says, "Upon being buried under ground, I found that my spirit did not depart this world as I would have thought.  For many years I could not comprehend the reason for this.  I existed only with my grief and my loneliness.  Then, slowly, the rocks began to move and I saw that the Lich was not dead.  She certainly was in no way human any more.  I knew then, why I had not left this place.  My task was not complete."
HunterGhost		sword of the hunt	~kTendrath says, "While the army lay siege to Brax, I spent weeks calling the magic of the earth.  Never before had I used my magic on weapons.  But I transformed the swords of the most brave into instruments of destruction.  The spirit of the sword was linked to its owner.  The link was strongest when they sought vengeance.  The swords deliver retribution."
HunterGhost		amulet	~kTendrath says, "I have only seen pendants on the rotting corpses of the Lich's minions.  Their magic is strange and foreign.  It is not the power of death that they hold.  Death is a natural thing.  Pendants are the vein which transform life into UNDEATH."
HunterGhost		urn	~kTendrath says, "I know little of the Urn. I have never seen it.  I know only that it was uncovered by a craftsman working on the foundation of the new palace. Within the Urn lurk the Three of the Urn."
HunterGhost		three of the Urn	~kTendrath says, "These devilish beings are but shadows that plague the living and coax them towards their own dark designs."
HunterGhost			~kTendrath says, "Beware the Necromancers.  They dwell here. Beware."
HunterGhost			~kTendrath says, "Shhh.  The lich dwells here.  She will hunger for the life within you. You must destroy her, if you wish your children to grow up in safety."
HunterGhost		amulet	~kTendrath says, "I have only seen amulets on the rotting corpses of the Lich's minions.  Their magic is strange and foreign.  It is not the power of death that they hold.  Death is a natural thing.  Pendants are the vein which transform life into UNDEATH."
