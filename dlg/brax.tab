PrincessLiege		brax	~kPrincess Kateriina says, "The King always told me Brax is where my families' bloodlines began.  It was my ancestor, Zarrus, who fled that land to settle in Tos."
PrincessLiege		brax	~kPrincess Kateriina says, "Of course I have heard the story of how the city fell beneath the earth by the magic of Tendrath.  I believe the exact historical location is somewhat southwest of here."
PrincessLiege		venya'cyr	~kPrincess Kateriina says, "Well, as the story goes, her reign ended when her entire palace was eaten by the earth.  Legends say that she made a pact to live forever."
PrincessLiege		Zarrus	~kPrincess Kateriina says, "Yes he is one of my oldest ancestors.  One rumor states that when he served in the court of Venya'cyr he had the misfortune of touching a vessel of great corruption.  Many of my family believe that we have been cursed from that day forward."
OneCouncilor		Venya'cyr	~kAlzahakar says, "The young princess had a brother.  The brother was King of Brax He was physically deformed and over the years he lost his voice.  The young princess was loved by the people and she performed many of the duties reserved for the king."
OneCouncilor		King of brax	~kAlzahakar says, "A misshapen man whose deformity always made his kingship suspect.  He lived in a time when people believed that the king represented the spirit of a nation.  Are things so different now?  The people did not want to see deformity."
OneCouncilor		brax	~kAlzahakar says, "It was to be the greatest seat of culture that the meridian had ever known.  They were a strong, organized peoples who suffered from self-righteousness and nobility.  Very dangerous for a city."
OneCouncilor		Zarrus	~kAlzahakar says, "Once a nobleman in the House of Brax, he was the cousin of the Princess Venya'cyr.  He fled the realm for Tos when the Ancient forces guiding Venya'cyr pronounced him a rival for the throne."
OneCouncilor		Zarrus	~kAlzahakar says, "Zarrus is an ancestor of the King Zarcos.  Zarrus was a cousin to Venya'cyr.  It takes no genius to figure out that the Lich, at one time, shared the bloodlines of our King.  I am sure she would like it to be thus again."
OneCouncilor		tendrath	~kAlzahakar says, "I know little of him.  His family was killed by Venya'cyr.  It is rumored that his ghost still wanders the land."
TwoCouncilor		Venya'cyr	~kBei Naq says, "I have heard the name but I recall nothing about the person."
TwoCouncilor		brax	~kBei Naq says, "A lost city whose treasures, should they be found, could prove very profitable for the one who finds them."
TwoCouncilor		Zarrus	~kBei Naq says, "An ancestor of Zarcos.  He began to build the fortune which would later bring his family to power.  I respect his tenacity as well as his methods."
TwoCouncilor		methods	~kBei Naq says, "It is rumored that he was a masterful negotiator who always kept his objectivity.  He was a diplomat for hire who had a knack for easing tension and acquiring wealth.  A potent combination wouldn't you say?"
TwoCouncilor		Tendrath	~kBei Naq says, "Who?"
ThreeCouncilor		brax	~kCylill says, "It was to be the greatest military power in the world.  The soldiers of Brax were ferocious warriors and their generals were skilled tacticians."
ThreeCouncilor		Zarrus	~kCylill says, "I know not of this man."
ThreeCouncilor		Tendrath	~kCylill says, "Tendrath was a weak man who used his power to destroy an entire city."
FourCouncilor		venya'cyr	~kDrechx says, "A truly despicable character.  She killed her own brother, Ker'toth."
FourCouncilor		brax 	~kDrechx says, "I am no historian.  Talk to the malnourished wizard Alzahakar if you want to know about such things.  Let me ask you this, Have you ever seen that man eat? I have not."
FourCouncilor		Zarrus	~kDrechx says, "Nope."
FourCouncilor		Zarrus	~kDrechx says, "Who?"
FourCouncilor		Tendrath	~kDrechx says, "Isn't he the new vault man in Tos?"
FourCouncilor		Ker'toth	~kDrechx says, "He was deformed, if I remember the story correctly.  The people did not like the fact that their leader was so hunched over and quiet.  The story said that the king lost his voice. How can you have a king with no voice?"
FiveCouncilor		Venya'cyr	~kEsseldi says, "Poor girl. She was trapped by the forces surrounding her.  Would you have done any different? Could you have done any different?  Can any of us say we have not succumbed to our darker instincts at some point? It just cost her more than it has the rest of us."
FiveCouncilor		Brax	~kEsseldi says, "Now there is a place I would have liked to see.  Tales of Brax are always about an enlightened civilization aspiring to construct the greatest city of their time.  How brave they must have been, and how foolish."
FiveCouncilor		Zarrus	~kEsseldi says, "This is probably not the most popular thing to say but, I think the man was a coward for leaving his city without standing to fight."
FarenPriestess		Brax	~kPriestess Tenuv'vyal says, "An ancient city.  It was destroyed because they ignored the powers of the land.  They chose civilization over nature.  Judge the results for yourself."
FarenPriestess		Venya'cyr	~kPriestess Tenuv'vyal says, "If there is one person I could destroy before they were ever born, it would be this abomination."
FarenPriestess		Zarrus	~kPriestess Tenuv'vyal says, "An unremarkable member of the Zarcos lineage, but then, most of their lineage is less than remarkable.  Aristocracy tends to breed with itself. This is not the way of nature."
FarenPriestess		tendrath	~kPriestess Tenuv'vyal says, "Never before or after has there walked a more righteous man.  All too well I understand his motives and his actions.  He represented all that was decent in that corrupt society."
KraananPriestess		brax	~kPriestess Qerti'nya says, "The warriors of Brax were undisciplined and lazy.  Because of that, they lost their city."
KraananPriestess		Venya'cyr	~kPriestess Qerti'nya says, "She got what she deserved."
KraananPriestess		Zarrus	~kPriestess Qerti'nya says, "What is your opinion of a man who leaves his country in its darkest hour to save himself."
KraananPriestess		tendrath	~kPriestess Qerti'nya says, "What do you want me say?  He was an old man who used magic. I know nothing else."
QorPriestess		Brax	~kPriestess Zuxana says, "An old city destroyed by the chaotic and unpredictable forces of nature.  How can so many trust those forces now and believe that they will guide them to salvation?  Nature cares little for the deeds or thoughts of humanity."
QorPriestess		Venya'cyr	~kPriestess Zuxana says, "Poor thing."
QorPriestess		Zarrus	~kPriestess Zuxana says, "The problems of our society can be traced back to this man and his deeds.  When times got hard for him he turned his tail and fled.  It is because of his juvenile fears that prejudice has been allowed to destroy many schools of thought.  This is your world.  Is this how you would have things?"
QorPriestess		Tendrath	~kPriestess Zuxana says, "I feel sorry for him.  Venya'cyr goes insane, kills his family, and he starts to fiddle with the chaotic powers of nature.  He was a tool.  I am sure his intentions were noble but the fact of the matter is he dealt in forces that he could not control and destroyed an entire city.  Because of him we have lost a culture."
ShalillePriestess		brax	~kPriestess Xiana says, "They were a people without the guidance of Shal'ille."
ShalillePriestess		VENYA'CYR	~kPriestess Xiana says, "Without faith in the harmony of all things, we are all more likely to turn towards that which promises the easy solution.  Venya'cyr took the easy path to her desires and it cost her eternal soul."
ShalillePriestess		Zarrus	~kPriestess Xiana says, "If he had not survived, the course of history would surely be different."
ShalillePriestess		Tendrath	~kPriestess Xiana says, "I pray for his soul every time I think of his tragedy."
RiijaMonk		brax	~kThe Monk of Riija says, "If the base of your house is made of air, it will surely topple."
RiijaMonk		Venya'cyr	~kThe Monk of Riija says, "She was a man."
RiijaMonk		Zarrus	~kThe Monk of Riija says, "The real Zarrus died in Brax."
RiijaMonk		tendrath	~kThe Monk of Riija says, "When the Prince dies before the King, it is a day to weep."
DarkWizard		Brax	~kMaleval says, "I remember the people of Brax as very industrious... perhaps too narrow in their vision... or perhaps merely very unlucky."
DarkWizard		Venya'cyr	~kMaleval says, "She was a child when she encountered one of the most powerful forces in the universe.  When the Ancient one opened his eyes and saw her, her soul became a toy."
DarkWizard		Zarrus	~kMaleval says, "You must give the man credit for escaping the destruction of his homeland.  He was a shameless survivor."
DarkWizard		Ancient one	~kMaleval says, "Why don't you ask the priestesses about them.  I would be interested to hear their response."
DarkWizard		ancient ones	~kMaleval says, "Please, do not demean your intellect by believing that the only powers in our world are those of some glorified heroes."
MarionElder		Brax	~kRan er'Hoth says, "An old city, destroyed by the foolish desires of a child."
MarionElder		Venya'cyr	~kRan er'Hoth says, "I have no tolerance or pity for her.  She made decisions that have hurt thousands of people.  Her mistake is still costing you and I today.  And what have we learned?  What good has come from her deeds?  It is too bad she was not destroyed a thousand years ago."
MarionElder		Tendrath	~kRan er'Hoth says, "In his situation, I would have done the same things he did.  It is rumored that the spirit of this man still roams the world beneath the earth.  Seek him out and you will find answers to many questions."
Heretic		Brax	~kMiriana says, "Brax, Brax, Brax, you will never get the facts."
Heretic		Venya'cyr	~kMiriana says, "The dreams of children.  The dreams of children can be very dangerous. I wonder if she knows about my dreams."
Heretic		Tendrath	~kMiriana says, "He is still around somewhere. I saw him.  Where did I see him?  I can not remember."
JasperElder		Brax	~kAfiera D'xor says, "We have much to learn from the mistakes of the past.  Brax was a terrible mistake, but what have we learned?"
JasperElder		Venya'cyr	~kAfiera D'xor says, "What of her?"
JasperElder		Tendrath	~kAfiera D'xor says, "I wish the poor man had achieved his goal all those years ago.  Then we would not have to deal with these tribulations today."
HunterGhost		Venya'cyr	~kTendrath says, "I was told longer after my eldest son's murder that it was, indeed, the Three of the Urn who first brought my name to the ears of Venya'cyr.  Her spirit was so foul.  Upon the words of demons she sent those men to my house!  To ensure her own immortality, she destroyed the bloodline that was my family.  She murdered my son, thinking it was me.  I was a simple man.  I would have suffered many things for our leader.  I asked for none of this.  But now... Now I will never rest until I see that creature gone from this world forever."
HunterGhost		Brax	~kTendrath says, "It was my city.  I am told that the people of Brax are no more.  That the purity of our people has been mingled with the blood of inferiors.  What is there to say?  Shall I tell you of how each person in Brax was born with magic within them.  That each persons' magic was unique.  That their character's were strong and honest.  They are no more and to speak of them gives me great pain."
HunterGhost		Underground caves	~kTendrath says, "When Kara'set was slain by the lich, all was lost.  Our greatest warrior was defeated.  The army had suffered many losses and retreated.  We had lost the swords within the walls of Brax.  The murderer of my son would go unpunished.  I sat alone.  I heard a sound and looked around.  A small animal was running into a large fissure in the ground.  Inside that fissure I found caves that led deep into the ground.  For days I traveled.  A huge cavern lay beneath our city.  There were ancient artifacts there from some forgotten people.  It was then that I knew what to do."
HunterGhost		Kara Set	~kTendrath says, "She was the most ferocious warrior Brax ever had.  She was Venya'cyr's close friend.  When Venya'cyr murdered the King, her own brother, Kara'set knew that her friend was no more. I personally saw Kara'set slay nearly three score necromancers on her way towards the palace and the Lich.  If anyone ever had the magic to kill the Lich it was her.  To face such things the soul must be pure.  Within Kara'set, the Lich saw a blemish.  Deep within the warrior there was guilt."
HunterGhost		guilt	~kTendrath says, "Before the King was murdered by Venya'cyr.  Kara'set had come to the princess and voiced her disapproval of the King.  There were certain military groups that felt his deformity could give their enemies the idea that the country was weak.  I know it sounds foolish.  You must understand the people of Brax to understand why Kara'set felt this way.  In some way Kara'set felt like she helped convince her closest friend to murder her brother."
HunterGhost		deformity	~kTendrath says, "The King of Brax had a curved spine and towards the end of his reign, had no voice whatsoever."
HunterGhost		Ker'Toth	~kTendrath says, "He was my King.  His sister murdered him.  His sister was Venya'cyr.  It was the powers of the Urn that originally corrupted the soul of the young princess.  It was this power which enabled the princess to sacrifice her own brother and leave a people without a leader."
HunterGhost		Nexus	~kTendrath says, "My grandfather remembers the Nexus.  It was a portal.  King Fahr'nohl would travel through the Nexus.  He brought many fine things to our world but I am sure he also brought many things that were dangerous.  When the Nexus disappeared, Fahr'nohl was finished. His power lay in his ability to travel the nexus and return.  His majesty faded and Castle Victoria was all but abandoned."
HunterGhost		Duke	~kTendrath says, "I hope this man is a strong leader.  If he is not we shall all feel the power of the ancients."
HunterGhost		Far Nohl	~kTendrath says, "He was the last man to travel the Nexus.  His authority and influence with the people came from his link to the Nexus.  The Nexus would take him to other worlds.  He would return from these other worlds with treasures and devices and knowledge.  The people worshipped him until the Nexus disappeared.  Castle Victoria was his home."
HunterGhost		ancients	~kTendrath says, "I know little of the story of the ancients.  I have heard many versions.  All of them make reference to a being that is not from this world but who 'sleeps' within our world.  The end of the world arrives when this creature fully wakes from its slumber."
HunterGhost		princess	~kTendrath says, "I hope the lessons of the past do not escape this child."
HunterGhost		tos	~kTendrath says, "They were timid warriors.  Let us hope that has at least changed."
HunterGhost		Kraanan	~kTendrath says, "These are your gods.  I suggest you pray to them."
HunterGhost		Shal'ille	~kTendrath says, "These are your gods.  Let us hope they will help their followers."
HunterGhost		Qor	~kTendrath says, "This dark god may have ties to the ancients. Beware this one. She is the youngest child of an old family."
HunterGhost		Riija	~kTendrath says, "These are your gods. I suggest you pray to them."
HunterGhost		FAren	~kTendrath says, "He is your god of nature.  I know him then.  Or rather I know of his kind.  Let us hope he still wields great power."
HunterGhost			~kTendrath says, "Oh my son.  I shall avenge you.  I shall never stop until she is dead."
HunterGhost			~kTendrath says, "Where has the sun gone?  It has been a thousand years since I have seen the sun."
HunterGhost			~kTendrath says, "Tordos is that you?  Oh, I thought my son had come to get me.  He was killed by Venya'cyr you know.  For that, she will pay."
Izzio		Brax	~kIzzio almost stops smiling, "Well you know that really isn't my kinda place."
Izzio		Venya'Cyr	~kIzzio says, "You might want to ask Miriana."
